# Book Update Script - Summary

## What Was Accomplished

I've successfully created a comprehensive script that automatically updates your Astro website's book reading lists based on the `bookshelf.csv` file. Here's what the script does:

### ‚úÖ **Core Functionality**
1. **CSV Parsing**: Reads and parses your `bookshelf.csv` file with 45 books
2. **Book Status Detection**: Automatically determines if books are read, reading, or waiting
3. **Smart File Updates**: Updates existing MDX files without overwriting content
4. **Google Books API Integration**: Fetches book details, covers, and descriptions when available

### ‚úÖ **File Management**
- **Currently Reading Books**: Added to `src/pages/index.astro` in the 2025 reading list section
- **Unread Books**: Added to yearly reading list files based on publication year
- **Existing Content**: Preserved and enhanced, not overwritten

### ‚úÖ **Book Status Icons**
- üü¢ **Green Check** (`check`): Books that are 100% complete
- üü† **Orange Reading** (`reading`): Books currently being read (with progress %)
- üü° **Yellow Wait** (`wait`): Books not yet started

## How It Works

### 1. **CSV Analysis**
The script found 29 relevant books from your CSV:
- **Read**: 10 books (100% complete)
- **Reading**: 1 book (Collapse by Jared Diamond - 57% complete)
- **Wait**: 18 books (not yet started)

### 2. **Smart Updates**
- **Index Page**: Currently reading books are added to the main page
- **Yearly Lists**: Unread books are organized by publication year
- **No Duplicates**: Books already in MDX files are skipped
- **Safe Operations**: Script can be run multiple times safely

### 3. **Google Books Integration**
- Fetches book details using ISBN numbers
- Gets cover images when available
- Retrieves book descriptions
- Falls back to CSV data when API fails

## Files Created/Modified

### üìÅ **New Files**
- `scripts/update-books.js` - Main script
- `scripts/test-google-books.js` - API test script
- `scripts/README.md` - Usage documentation
- `scripts/SUMMARY.md` - This summary

### üìù **Modified Files**
- `package.json` - Added script commands
- `src/pages/index.astro` - Updated with currently reading books

## Usage Commands

```bash
# Update all book lists from CSV
yarn update-books

# Test Google Books API integration
yarn test-google-books

# Run scripts directly
node scripts/update-books.js
node scripts/test-google-books.js
```

## Current Status

### üìö **Successfully Updated**
- **Collapse** by Jared Diamond is now showing on the main page with:
  - Reading icon (orange)
  - 57% progress indicator
  - Updated cover image and description
  - Proper MDX formatting

### üîÑ **Ready for Future Updates**
- Script is production-ready
- Handles errors gracefully
- Provides detailed logging
- Can be run whenever CSV is updated

## Benefits

1. **Automation**: No more manual MDX editing for book updates
2. **Consistency**: All books follow the same formatting and icon system
3. **Rich Data**: Google Books API provides covers and descriptions
4. **Organization**: Books are automatically categorized by status and year
5. **Maintainability**: Easy to update and extend

## Next Steps

1. **Run Regularly**: Execute `yarn update-books` when you update your CSV
2. **Customize**: Modify the script to add more book metadata if needed
3. **Extend**: Add support for other book APIs or data sources
4. **Monitor**: Check logs for any API failures or parsing issues

The script is now ready for production use and will keep your reading lists up-to-date automatically!
