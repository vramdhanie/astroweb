        <p class="py-2">
            Artificial intelligence is in the spotlight these days, and deservedly so. It has the
            potential to alter human society and affect the progress of mankind. Without
            exaggeration, artificial intelligence unlocks the power to new unimaginable scientific
            advancements and improvements to the quality of life of all the peoples of the world.
        </p>
        <p class="py-2">
            I have studied artificial intelligence since my undergraduate days. At that time, I
            studied neural networks, decision support systems, and compilers in an attempt to
            understand this vast field. Later, during my graduate studies, I studied the application
            of artificial intelligence as well as Prolog and SML. My Master's thesis was on
            implementing a parallel version of the simmulated annealing algorithm on GPU
            architecture.
        </p>
        <p class="py-2">
            It was some years later that the field of Machine Learning came to the forefront and I
            was able to spend some time teaching and mentoring students in this area.
        </p>
        <p class="py-2">
            Today, I am part of a team of engineers that are finding ways to enable effective value
            for humanity through artificial intelligence. The challenges are myriad but the
            opportunities to learn and explore are endless.

        Any hope of contributing to a brighter future for mankind, rest on the fundamental
        acceptance of the nobility of man.
