                    This is an excellent podcast from Neil deGrasse Tyson. He talks about a wide
                    range of topics, from the origin of life to the nature of dark matter. He also
                    talks about pop culture and the impact of science on society. The show is a bit
                    commercial radio in that it never gets a chance to investigate topics as deeply
                    as I would like but it is funny and does introduce many luminaries in the field.
