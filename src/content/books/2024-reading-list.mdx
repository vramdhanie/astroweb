                    This book explores the concept of time from a physics perspective. Richard A. Muller
                    delves into the nature of time, its relationship with space, and how it is perceived
                    by humans. The book provides a comprehensive understanding of time, combining
                    scientific theories with philosophical insights.

                    This is a well-argued stance on reality and our perception of reality. The basic
                    concept is that we do not percieve the truth of reality, rather, we percieve
                    reality in the way that maximises our chance of survival. The argument is that
                    we create a reality when we observe the world. That reality that we create may
                    not be the objective reality.

                    A well written mystery with good old fashioned human monsters. The detective
