                    A bit dark. Proposes a bleak outlook on the relationship between civilizations
                    in the universe. Incredibly well written.

                    A satisfying end to the saga. Wraps up the story well and introduces some hope
                    which was a relief after the dark outlook of the previous book. Surprisingly,
                    was able to continue introducing new concepts and exploring intriguing ideas up

                    Traces the development of the brain through all of history and shows how
                    evolution built new functionality into the brain on top of more primitive
                    versions of the brain.

                    The presentation is excellent. Builds up the universe from the most fundamental
                    particle up to life and intelligence. Reframes our understanding of the physical
                    universe as well as what it means to be intelligent. I wish there was more
                    technical discussion on the implementation of the brain. However, the high level
                    ideas are quite useful and goes a long way towards helping you understand the
                    requirements for building truly intelligent life.

                    The first few trillionths of a second after the big bang was an incredibly
                    active and mysterious time in our universe. Dan Hooper explores these few
                    moments and explain how our universe may have come to be. He takes us to the
                    edge of our current understanding and surveys the various unanswered questions
                    that scientists are struggling with today.

                        I'm probably not going to complete this book. It is brilliantly written and
                        quite compelling but the last few chapters feel like a chore.
