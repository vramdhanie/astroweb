# Home Made Paving Stone Installation

Over the recent holiday break my family spent some time installing paving stones in a small section of the front yard. 
These paving stones were made by us over the course of the last few months. We have 5 moulds and managed to make about
75 stones in total.

## Preparing the area

Clear the area and estimate the number of stones that you may need.

## Remove 4 inches of dirt

This is a labour intensive part so ensure you have enough labour.

Try to get the ground as level as possible but don't worry if it isn't. We will be using sand to
level the dirt.

## Add Sand

We used *sharp sand* for this step.
