# Home Made Paving Stone Installation

Over the recent holiday break my family spent some time installing paving stones in a small section of the front yard. 
These paving stones were made by us over the course of the last few months. We have 5 moulds and managed to make about
75 stones in total.

## Preparing the area

Clear the area and estimate the number of stones that you may need. We decided to use irregular shaped
stones that we made ourselves from moulds that we bought. The paving stones were about 18 inches across 
each. We estimated we may need 45 stones to cover the area.

We started by removing all objects from the area and ensuring that we had enough space to work.

## Remove 4 inches of dirt

This is a labour intensive part so ensure you have enough willing labour.

Try to get the ground as level as possible but don't worry if it isn't. We will be using sand to
level the dirt. The main struggle with this step was knowing how deep to dig. It turned out that 
we went a bit too deep in some areas.

## Add Sand

We used *sharp sand* for this step.
