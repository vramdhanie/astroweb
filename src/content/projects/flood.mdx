# 🌊 Flood Game

A modern, responsive flood game built with React 18, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS. The objective is to flood the entire grid with a single color in the smallest number of steps possible.

## 🎮 Live Demo

Play the game now at: [https://vramdhanie.github.io/flood](https://vramdhanie.github.io/flood)

## ✨ Features

* 🎯 **Strategic Gameplay**: Plan your moves to minimize steps
* 📊 **Real-time Stats**: Track steps, progress percentage, and cells owned
* 🏆 **Win Detection**: Automatic celebration when you flood the entire grid
* 🔄 **Instant Restart**: Play again without page refresh
* 📱 **Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on desktop and mobile
* 🎨 **Modern UI**: Clean, intuitive interface with smooth animations
* ⚡ **Performance Optimized**: Efficient flood-fill algorithm

## 🎯 How to Play

1. **Start**: The grid begins with random colors, and you control the top-left cell
2. **Select Color**: Click any color button to flood your territory with that color
3. **Expand**: All adjacent cells of the selected color join your territory
4. **Strategy**: Choose colors that will capture the most adjacent cells
5. **Win**: Flood the entire 30×30 grid in the fewest steps possible!

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Node.js 18+
* pnpm (recommended) or npm

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/vramdhanie/flood.git
cd flood

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server
pnpm start

# Build for production
pnpm build
```

The game will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

### Frontend Technologies

* **React 18**: Modern React with hooks and functional components
* **TypeScript**: Full type safety and enhanced developer experience
* **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development
* **Create React App**: Zero-configuration React development environment

### Development Tools

* **Package Manager**: pnpm for fast, efficient dependency management
* **Code Quality**: ESLint with TypeScript strict mode
* **Build Tool**: Create React App with optimized production builds
* **Deployment**: GitHub Pages with automated GitHub Actions

## 🧠 Game Algorithm

### Flood-Fill Implementation

The game uses an efficient **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** flood-fill algorithm:

1. **Color Change**: All owned cells change to the selected color
2. **BFS Expansion**: Starting from owned cells, expand to adjacent cells of the same color
3. **Territory Growth**: Newly captured cells become part of your territory
4. **Win Detection**: Check if all cells are owned after each move

### Performance Optimization

* **Efficient Data Structures**: Optimized grid representation for fast updates
* **Smart Boundary Detection**: Minimal cell checks during expansion
* **Memory Management**: Efficient state updates without unnecessary re-renders
* **Algorithm Complexity**: O(n) where n is the number of cells to update

## 🎯 Game Rules & Mechanics

### Grid Specifications

* **Grid Size**: 30×30 cells (900 total)
* **Colors**: 6 different colors to choose from
* **Starting Position**: Top-left cell is your initial territory
* **Victory Condition**: Own all 900 cells

### Scoring System

* **Primary Goal**: Minimize the number of steps to achieve the best score
* **Real-time Feedback**: Track progress percentage and cells owned
* **Win Celebration**: Visual feedback upon completion

### Strategy Tips

* **Analyze the Grid**: Look for color clusters that will maximize expansion
* **Plan Ahead**: Consider which colors will give you the most territory
* **Edge Strategy**: Focus on colors that reach the grid boundaries
* **Color Frequency**: Choose colors that appear most frequently adjacent to your territory
