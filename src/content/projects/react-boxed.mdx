## 🧩 Game Mechanics

### How to Play

1. **Letter Arrangement**: Drag and drop letters to arrange them in the game grid
2. **Word Discovery**: Find pairs of words that use all available characters
3. **Real-time Feedback**: Get instant validation of word combinations
4. **Solution Finding**: Use the efficient Trie-based algorithm to discover all possible solutions

### Algorithm Implementation

The game uses a **Trie data structure** for efficient word searching:

* **Fast Lookups**: O(m) time complexity for word searches, where m is word length
* **Memory Efficient**: Optimized storage of word dictionary
* **Prefix Matching**: Enables efficient partial word validation
* **Real-time Performance**: Handles large word lists without lag

### Word Search Features

* **Dictionary Integration**: Comprehensive word list for challenging gameplay
* **Pattern Matching**: Find words that fit specific letter arrangements
* **Solution Generation**: Automatically discover all valid word pairs
* **Performance Optimization**: Efficient algorithms for smooth gameplay

## 🎨 User Interface

### Design Principles

* **Clean and Modern**: Minimalist design focused on gameplay
* **Intuitive Controls**: Easy-to-understand drag and drop interface
* **Responsive Layout**: Adapts to different screen sizes and orientations
* **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation and screen reader support
* **Visual Feedback**: Clear indicators for valid and invalid moves

### Component Architecture

* **Modular Design**: Reusable components for maintainability
* **State Management**: Efficient React state handling with hooks
* **Event Handling**: Smooth drag and drop interactions
* **Animation**: Subtle transitions for enhanced user experience

## 🚀 Deployment

### Automated Deployment

This project is configured to automatically deploy to GitHub Pages when changes are pushed to the main branch. The deployment process is handled by GitHub Actions.

### Manual Deployment

1. **Update the base property** in `vite.config.ts` with your repository name:
   ```typescript
   export default defineConfig({
     base: '/react-boxed/',
     // ... other config
   });
   ```

2. **Push your changes** to the main branch:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **GitHub Action** will automatically build and deploy your site to GitHub Pages
4. **Your site** will be available at `https://vramdhanie.github.io/react-boxed/`

### Setting up GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository settings
2. Navigate to the "Pages" section
3. Under "Build and deployment", select "GitHub Actions" as the source
4. Your site will be deployed automatically when you push to the main branch
