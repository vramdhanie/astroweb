# Monty Hall Simulator

CIS220 Sample code that implements a Monty Hall simulator to demonstrate probability theory and statistical analysis.

## 🎯 The Problem

The Monty Hall problem is a famous probability puzzle based on the game show "Let's Make a Deal." Here's how it works:

Given three doors where a random door contains a prize and the other doors do not:
1. The player selects a door at random
2. Another non-winning door is exposed (revealing no prize)
3. The player has the choice to change their mind or stick with their original choice

**The Question**: Does changing your mind affect the probability of winning?

## 🧮 Probability Theory

### The Counterintuitive Answer

* **Sticking with original choice**: 1/3 probability of winning (33.33%)
* **Changing your choice**: 2/3 probability of winning (66.67%)

This result often surprises people because it seems like there should be a 50-50 chance after one door is revealed. However, the key insight is that the host's action of revealing a door provides additional information that changes the probability distribution.

### Mathematical Explanation

When you first choose a door:
- Probability of choosing the correct door: 1/3
- Probability of choosing an incorrect door: 2/3

If you initially chose incorrectly (2/3 probability), the host must reveal the other incorrect door, leaving only the correct door. Therefore, switching gives you a 2/3 chance of winning.

## 🚀 Features

* **Statistical Simulation**: Run thousands of game rounds to verify theoretical probabilities
* **Two Strategies**: Compare "stick" vs "switch" strategies
* **Detailed Analysis**: Track win rates, loss rates, and statistical significance
* **Educational Value**: Demonstrate probability concepts through practical simulation
* **Gradle Build System**: Modern Java project structure with dependency management

## 🛠️ Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

* Java JDK 8 or higher
* Gradle (latest version recommended)

## 🎮 How the Simulation Works

### Game Flow

1. **Initialization**: Three doors are set up, one randomly contains a prize
2. **Player Choice**: Player selects one door at random
3. **Host Action**: Host reveals one of the remaining doors (always a non-prize door)
4. **Player Decision**: Player chooses to stick with original choice or switch
5. **Result**: Outcome is recorded and statistics are updated

### Strategy Comparison

The simulator runs two parallel strategies:
- **Strategy A**: Always stick with the original choice
- **Strategy B**: Always switch to the remaining unopened door

### Statistical Analysis

* **Sample Size**: Configurable number of game rounds
* **Win Rates**: Calculate success percentages for each strategy
* **Confidence Intervals**: Statistical significance of results
* **Variance Analysis**: Measure consistency of outcomes

## 📊 Expected Results

### Theoretical Probabilities

* **Stick Strategy**: 33.33% win rate
* **Switch Strategy**: 66.67% win rate

### Simulation Validation

Running the simulator with a large number of rounds (e.g., 100,000) should produce results very close to these theoretical values, demonstrating the power of statistical simulation in validating mathematical concepts.
